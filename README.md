I like penguins... they are cool
I made this account to edit a wiki, but I eventually want to learn how to use GitHub with my coding projects in Unity. I know some Java and C#, but I'm looking to expand it. I am also looking to eventually learn C++ and Python

I dont know what else to add, so that's all for now.
penguins are cool
